  <h1>Description:</h1>
  <p>This easy, cheesy ham and potato casserole uses up leftover Christmas or Easter ham! It's perfect for a post-holiday breakfast or an easy weeknight dinner. My family looks forward to this classic combination.
  </p>
  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <ul>6 small potatoes</ul>
  <ul>7 tablespoons butter</ul>
  <ul>2/3 pound leftover cooked ham</ul>
  <ul>1 small onion</ul>
  <ul>3 tablespoons all purpose flour</ul>
  <ul>1.5 cups of milk</ul>
  <ul>salt and ground black Pepper</ul>
  <ul>1 (8 ounce)package shredded Cheddar cheese</ul>
  <ul>1/4 cup bread crumbs</ul>
  <h1>Steps:</h1>
  <ol>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.</ol>
  <ol>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 1 1/2-quart baking dish.</ol>
  <ol>When the potatoes are almost finished, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add ham and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</ol>
  <ol>Drain potatoes; add to the ham mixture and stir to combine. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.</ol>
  <ol>Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 5 minutes.</ol>
  <ol>Gradually whisk milk into the flour mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Continue cooking and stirring until thickened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in Cheddar cheese until melted.</ol>
  <ol>Pour cheese sauce over ham and potatoes. Sprinkle bread crumbs over top.</ol>
  <ol>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and browned, 25 to 30 minutes.</ol>
